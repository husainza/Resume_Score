2. Open the application in your browser
3. The application will automatically initialize with your embedded API key

### 2. Job Description
1. Enter the job title (optional but recommended)
2. Paste the job description in the text area
3. Alternatively, upload a JD file (TXT, DOC, DOCX, PDF)

### 3. Upload CVs
1. Drag and drop CV files onto the upload zone
2. Or click to browse and select files
3. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, DOC
4. Maximum 200 files per session

### 4. Analysis
1. Click "Analyze CVs" to start processing
2. Monitor progress with the real-time progress bar
3. Results will appear automatically when complete

### 5. Review Results
1. View ranked candidates in the sortable table
2. Use filters to narrow down results by score or search terms
3. Click "View" to see detailed candidate information
4. Export results as CSV or JSON

## üîß Configuration

### API Key Setup
1. Open `app.js` in a text editor
2. Find the line: `const EMBEDDED_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE';`
3. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key
4. Save the file

Example:
```javascript
const EMBEDDED_API_KEY = 'sk-...'; // Your actual OpenAI API key here
```

### API Key Management
- API key is embedded directly in the code (`app.js`)
- Replace `'sk-your-openai-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key
- The key is never stored in browser localStorage
- Keep your API key secure and don't share the code publicly
- For production use, consider using environment variables or secure key management

### Batch Processing
- Default batch size: 5 CVs per batch
- 1-second delay between batches to respect rate limits
- Adjustable in the code if needed

### File Size Limits
- Maximum 200 files per session
- Individual file size limited by browser memory
- Recommended: Keep individual files under 10MB

## üìä Understanding Results

### Relevance Score (0-100)
- **85-100**: Exceptional - Perfect match, significantly exceeds requirements
- **70-84**: Good - Meets most requirements with strong potential
- **55-69**: Fair - Meets some requirements, significant gaps present
- **35-54**: Poor - Meets few requirements, major gaps
- **0-34**: Very Poor - Does not meet requirements

The scoring system uses a strict evaluation framework that considers:
- **Role Match (30%)**: How closely the candidate's role matches the job title
- **Experience Relevance (25%)**: Years of experience in the exact field
- **Skills Match (20%)**: Alignment with required technical and soft skills
- **Education (15%)**: Educational background and field relevance
- **Achievements & Impact (10%)**: Demonstrated accomplishments and results

Additional deductions are applied for employment gaps, job hopping, missing certifications, and other red flags.

### Extracted Information
- **Name**: Full name of the candidate
- **Role**: Most recent job title/position
- **Company**: Most recent employer
- **Duration**: Time in current role
- **Education**: Highest education level achieved
- **Summary**: Key qualifications and experience
- **Rationale**: Detailed explanation of the score

## üîí Security & Privacy

- No data is stored on external servers
- API keys are stored locally in browser

### Privacy Considerations
- CV content is transmitted to Anthropic's servers for analysis
- Review Anthropic's privacy policy for data handling
- Consider data retention policies for your use case

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to initialize OpenAI client"**
- Check that you've replaced `'sk-your-openai-api-key-here'` with your actual API key in `app.js`
- Verify your API key format (should start with `sk-`)
- Ensure you have an active OpenAI API subscription
- Verify internet connectivity

**"Analysis failed"**
- Check that your embedded OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient quota
- Ensure job description is not empty
- Verify CV files are in supported formats
